# CS:GO Exploratory Data Analysis üñ•Ô∏è :gun:

## Background
This repo contains multiple jupyter notebooks with analysis of different dataframes of data taken from competitive CS:GO matches over the course of 4 years (Apr 2016-Mar 2020).

All the analysis and modelling is written with Python using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sci-kit Learn, TensorFLow, and Statsmodels. 

## Data

The data is taken and scraped from hltv.org, a competitive CS:GO hub.
We are working with 3 .csv files that split different aspects of the CS:GO.
